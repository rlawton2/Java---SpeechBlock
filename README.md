# Text to speech application
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlawton2/Java-SpeechBlock/master/Banner3.png)

## Description
I got the inspiration to make this application after watching a tutorial posted by ProgrammingKnowledge. Here is the link to the video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swuYhvwHw9w). The finished application has many modifications than the one created in the tutorial which I will discuss in the Project Details section.

## Project Details
This project makes use of the FreeTTS API for Java to provide text to speech. When ran, the application UI first greets the user by accessing the User Account Control (UAC) in Windows and determining if it is the morning, afternoon, or evening. Instructions and a text area are present for a user to follow and type a phrase to be spoken back. Ther are two types of voices available and either can be selected with the radio buttons. At the bottom of the UI, is a button that will give the current time of day when selected.
